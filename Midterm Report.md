# Midterm Report

## Overview
This midterm report documents the combined work completed during Week 1 and Week 2 of the project. The objective of this phase was to understand financial time series data, analyze historical stock prices, compute returns across multiple horizons, and perform feature engineering using rolling statistics.

All tasks described in this report are implemented in the notebook `submission-week2.ipynb`.

## Data Collection and Setup

### Asset Selection
A set of large-cap US equities was selected for analysis:
- AAPL
- MSFT
- GOOG
- AMZN
- TSLA

These assets were chosen due to their high liquidity, long trading history, and relevance in financial analysis.

### Data Source
Historical market data was fetched using the `yfinance` library with `auto_adjust=False` to explicitly work with adjusted close prices.

Two datasets were created:
- **Long-term data (2015–2024)** for broad statistical analysis
- **Medium-term data (2021–2024)** for return and feature calculations

Only the **Adjusted Close** price series was used for analysis to ensure correctness in the presence of dividends and stock splits.

## Descriptive Statistics of Adjusted Prices

### Objective
To understand the statistical characteristics of long-term stock price data.

### Work Done
- Extracted adjusted close prices for all selected assets
- Computed summary statistics using `.describe()`

### Explanation
This step provides insights into:
- Central tendency (mean, median)
- Dispersion (standard deviation)
- Range (min, max)
- Distribution shape (quartiles)

Understanding these statistics helps assess price behavior, volatility differences across assets, and suitability for further analysis.

## Return Computation Across Multiple Horizons

### Objective
To analyze price movements over different time scales.

### Work Done
For a selected asset (AMZN):
- Computed **1-day simple & log returns**
- Computed **5-day simple & log returns**
- Computed **20-day simple & log returns**
- Computed **5-day rolling standard deviation (volatility) of the log returns**
- Computed **20-day rolling standard deviation (volatility) of the log returns**
- Computed **60-day rolling standard deviation (volatility) of the log returns**

using percentage change (`pct_change`).

### Explanation
- **1-day returns** capture short-term market noise
- **5-day returns** approximate weekly movements
- **20-day returns** represent monthly trends

This comparison highlights how return distributions change with time horizon and demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate return intervals in financial modeling.

## Rolling Statistics for Trend and Volatility

### Objective
To extract time-varying statistical features from returns.

### Work Done
- Computed rolling mean of returns
- Computed rolling standard deviation of returns
- Used a fixed rolling window size

### Explanation
Rolling statistics help capture:
- Local trends (rolling mean)
- Time-varying volatility (rolling standard deviation)

These features are critical in financial analysis because markets are non-stationary, and global statistics fail to capture local dynamics.

---

## Feature Engineering Function

### Objective
To modularize feature creation for reuse and scalability.

### Work Done
- Implemented a feature generation function
- Included:
  - Current returns
  - Lagged returns
  - Rolling mean
  - Rolling volatility
- Handled missing values generated by shifting and rolling operations

### Explanation
This task formalizes the feature engineering pipeline. Instead of ad-hoc calculations, features are systematically generated in a structured format suitable for modeling. This step reflects real-world quantitative workflows where reproducibility and consistency are essential.

## Long-Term Investment Analysis

### Objective
To apply financial concepts to a real-world investment scenario.

### Work Done
- Selected NVDA as the investment asset
- Calculated investment growth from the stock’s initial trading date
- Simulated investing $1000 at inception
- Computed current portfolio value
- Compared investment value to the cost of consumer goods (RTX 4090 GPU)

### Explanation
This task demonstrates:
- Compounding effects over long time horizons
- Interpretation of price appreciation in practical terms
- Translation of abstract returns into tangible economic outcomes

It bridges theoretical financial analysis with intuitive real-world reasoning.

---

## Key Learnings and Insights
- Adjusted prices are essential for accurate historical analysis
- Return behavior varies significantly with time horizon
- Rolling statistics are crucial for capturing market dynamics
- Feature engineering is the backbone of quantitative modeling
- Long-term investing highlights the power of compounding

## Conclusion
The combined work of Week 1 and Week 2 successfully establishes a strong foundation in financial data analysis and feature engineering. The tasks completed during this phase prepare the groundwork for predictive modeling and strategy development in subsequent stages of the project.
